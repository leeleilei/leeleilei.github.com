There are many productive software and tools to boost your "GTD" and make your informative life organised, while after years of struggling and practice, here's a list of "MUST TRY". Keep using it and fit it in your life, then you will be like a "BOSS".

## Github
Use it as your blog and code base like this website.

## Google G-suit
Online docs and sheets are much more easiler and free to collaborate one another and open-to-use.

## Evernote
This is such a beautiful toolkit, by which you can collect and draft all your ideas on the cyber world

## Microsoft TODO
Try it instead of Google ToDo and you will love it.

## Fit your life in the above tools
Most important idea is trying to make best use of them and fit your life in them. When you need or are desire to search for new tool, try to ask yourself, "Do I really need one?". 

Always Keep It Simple & Hunger.
