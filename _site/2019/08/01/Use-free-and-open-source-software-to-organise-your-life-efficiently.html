<h2 id="github">Github</h2>
<p>Use it as your blog and code base like this website.</p>

<h2 id="google-g-suit">Google G-suit</h2>
<p>Online docs and sheets are much more easiler and free to collaborate one another and open-to-use.</p>

<h2 id="evernote">Evernote</h2>
<p>This is such a beautiful toolkit, by which you can collect and draft all your ideas on the cyber world</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-todo">Microsoft TODO</h2>
<p>Try it instead of Google ToDo and you will love it.</p>

<h2 id="fit-your-life-in-the-above-tools">Fit your life in the above tools</h2>
<p>Most important idea is trying to make best use of them and fit your life in them. When you need or are desire to search for new tool, try to ask yourself, “Do I really need one?”.</p>
