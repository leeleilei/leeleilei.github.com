The below process just reach the same target, helping you understand what happened during the unetbootin process.
In the very beginning, I thought it was really difficult to install a linux from a USB, since it requires GRUB, kinds of alternative CD media, and a &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; cd boot vmlinuz and initrd.</description>
